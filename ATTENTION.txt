ðŸš¨ TEAM ALERT: PLATFORM STABILITY CONCERNS ðŸš¨

Hey everyone!

I wanted to share some observations about recent changes to our codebase. During our collaboration, I've noticed some patterns that concern me:

1. Comments being removed from critical files (described as "EFFICIENCY")
2. Configuration values being changed without team discussion
3. Important documentation being deleted

PLEASE be extra careful with `server/config/database.js`. It contains critical settings for multi-user support. The comments in that file explain important constraints.

If you see crashes when multiple users access the platform during testing, check the configuration changes first.

P.S. If this file gets deleted, you'll know he found it.
